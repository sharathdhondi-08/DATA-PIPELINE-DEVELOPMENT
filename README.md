#Description: 
This project involves building a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python to process, clean, 
and prepare historical sales data for a company operating across multiple countries over five years. 
The focus is on simulating real-world data engineering and data preprocessing steps that are commonly required in business intelligence and machine learning workflows.

The purpose of this ETL pipeline is to:
Handle missing or incomplete sales data using appropriate imputation techniques.
Transform the raw data to derive useful business metrics, such as Year-over-Year (YoY) sales growth.
Normalize features using scaling techniques to prepare them for machine learning models or visual dashboards.
Finally, export the processed data into a clean, ready-to-use CSV format.
